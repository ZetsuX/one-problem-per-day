Let's call a positive integer n ordinary if in the decimal notation all its digits are the same. For example, 1, 2 and 99 are ordinary numbers, but 719 and 2021 are not ordinary numbers.

For a given number n, find the number of ordinary numbers among the numbers from 1 to n.

## Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Then t test cases follow.

Each test case is characterized by one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

## Output

For each test case output the number of ordinary numbers among numbers from 1 to n.
